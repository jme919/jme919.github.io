      <p>I was born in Richmond, Va but moved all over the country with my parents who were in the Army. After high school I moved
      to Charleston, SC and then to San Diego California. After I came back from San Diego I started working for an Audio/Video
      company. I have been there for the last nine years. In my free time I enjoy playing guitar, growing different plants, and
      paddle boarding when the weather is right.</p>
